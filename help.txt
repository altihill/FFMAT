"ffmat" is a mex function that can be called in MATLAB to demux/decode video
file using ffmpeg API. "ffmat" is short for "ffmpeg for MATLAB". In most 
cases, it is much faster than MATLAB built-in function VideoReader.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Syntax: 
	[output1, output2, ...] = ffmat('command',argument1,argument2,...);

For different command, argument number and output number may be variant.

Commands:
********'openvideo'********
	Status = ffmat('openvideo',filename);
	Status = ffmat('openvideo',filename,outputW);
	Status = ffmat('openvideo',filename,   0   ,outputH);
	Status = ffmat('openvideo',filename,outputW,outputH);
	Status = ffmat('openvideo',filename,   0   ,   0   ,outputPixFmt);
	Status = ffmat('openvideo',filename,   0   ,outputH,outputPixFmt);
	Status = ffmat('openvideo',filename,outputW,   0   ,outputPixFmt);
	Status = ffmat('openvideo',filename,outputW,outputH,outputPixFmt);
	function: Open video file, should be called before using other 
		  command.	
	input: filename is the whole videofile name, and should be string.
	       outputW, outputH are the output resolution, and should be
           numeric. If one of those are not given or zero, default value 
	       would be applied. outputPixFmt is the output pixel format, 
	       and should be string. 'Gray','R','G','B','RGB','Y','U','V',
	       'YUV' are all the valid value currently.
	return: Status is 1 if success. Otherwise it is negative.

********'getprop'********
	[Status, Property] = ffmat('getprop');
	function: Get property value of opened video file.
	return: Status is 1 if success. Otherwise it is negative.
		Property is a 1x1 structure array, while its fields contains 
		property values of the video file. Please note that for some
		formats, property valuse may not be 100% correct.

********'readframe'********
	[TimeStamp, RawImage] = ffmat('readframe');
	function: Read and decode the next frame.
	return: TimeStamp is the timestamp of the returned frame in seconds,
		if success. Otherwise it is negative. -1 means end of the 
		file. -2 means decoding error. RawImage is a HxW/HxWx3 uint8
		array, which is the decoded image. 

********'pickframe'********
	[TimeStamp, RawImage] = ffmat('pickframe',frameidx);
	function: Pick and decode one specific frame. This will also lead to 
		  the consequence that the next "readframe" call will return
		  the frame next to the picked frame.
	input: frameidx is the index of the required frame. The frame index
	       starts from 1, not 0.
	return: TimeStamp is the timestamp of the returned frame in seconds,
		if success. Otherwise it is negative. -1 means end of the 
		file. -2 means decoding error. -3 means seeking error. 
		RawImage is an HxW/HxWx3 uint8 array, which is the decoded image.

********'seekframe'********
	TimeStamp = ffmat('seekframe',frameidx);
	function: Seek to specific frame so that the next "readframe" will
		  return the corresponding frame.
	input: frameidx is the index of the frame that the next "readframe" 
	       call will return. The frame index starts from 1, not 0.
	return: TimeStamp is the current timestamp after seeking in seconds, 
		if success. Please note that this timestamp should be 
		smaller than the timestamp of the seeked frame. It is 
		negative, if failed. -1 means end of the file. -2 means 
		decoding error. -3 means seeking error.

********'closevideo'********
	Status = ffmat('closevideo');
	function: Close the video file and release the memory.
	return: Status is 1 if success. Otherwise it is negative.
